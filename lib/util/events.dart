    "details": " To Grab Attention | To Trigger Change |To Inspire Action. Do you want to learn how to lead, engage and inspire people to action with a proven toolkit in the Powerful Art of Storytelling? In the two-day storytelling workshop, we work with shared intentions of increasing your impact in the world through storytelling. The purpose of storytelling is not to tell you how to think, but to tell stories that make you think! Storytelling is a powerful way to connect ideas and people. This course will help you see and understand any issue from varying perspectives; it will enable you to open your mind to new perspectives and to connect with a concept or topic on a more personal level. Two-day workshop structure? The two-day storytelling workshop is an experiential and interactive workshop that engages all six human senses.  We use music, games, objects and photos to create a safe space to explore the art of telling compelling stories that shift mindsets.  This workshop consists of a wide range of stories, including fables, folktales, and true stories. They come from various parts of the world. Each presents its own style and flavour, and each teaches us some lessons. The following aspects will be covered in the two-day workshop: What is a story? How are stories told at work different from other stories? How to choose the right story for your audience? How to grab the attention of the audience with an appropriate-powerful story? How to structure a story using the Penduka framework of storytelling? How to improve your storytelling skills with safe practice sessions? Understanding the theory of change and storytelling as a change management tool. Experiencing the power of framing and reframing.   What will you learn? You will learn how to incorporate all 5 senses in telling stories so that it triggers an emotional response from your audience. You will practice the steps in the structure of telling stories. You will learn the skill on how to drive your story toward a single unforgettable point or value.   What Will You Take Away from the Course? After attending the course, you will know how to bring dry facts and figures to life when you reframe them as human experience. Your calibration skills will be awakened, and you will know just what to do when your audience is losing interest. Walk away after the course with the confidence that you will be heard, be remembered and you will know the power of telling inspiring and compelling stories.     About the Facilitator Dan Ellappa is a Business Leadership and Executive Coach and Story Teller with over 25 years of experience in bringing about transformational change within organisations.  Head of Penduka Coaching, Dan has a Master’s Degree in Business Leadership and has spearheaded countless training for global and local organisations.
